  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <p>The two datasets I have chosen displays CO2 emmissions in metric tons
     from major companies across the country. They allow us to see the outputs
     of companies that produce many different types of substances including
     chemicals, metals, minerals, electricity, food and more. The interest I
     have in choosing two very similiar charts is the ability to compare them
     over time. For a large scale project it would be beneficial to collect
     the same tables of data over a ten or twenty year span in order to
     see how effectively we have been dealing with the emmissions from our
     factories. I believe visualizing this data could display the factory types
     that produce the most emmissions which would be useful in finding the
     factories that need the most attention in order to reduce emmissions.
     You could even go further and graph the data on
     a picture of the United States using the longitudes and latitudes input
     in order to place the data based on its real life location in order
     to display the emmissions based on the state that factory is in.
     This could give further insight into what areas are taking the making the
     most changes to their emmission sizes and what areas aren't.

  <h3>Other Oppurtunities</h3>
  <p>   With a little more research and a few more datasets based around the
    measures taken to reduce emissions at these factories we could also discover
    which brands of emission reducing filters work the best for certain
    factory types. We could also compare the emissions datasets to the
    growth in global warming over time in order to identify if the changes
    we are making are helping to slow or decrease the changes possibly using
    a heat map visualization.
