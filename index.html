  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <p>The two datasets I have chosen displays CO2 emmissions in metric tons
     from major companies across the country. They allow us to see the outputs
     of companies that produce many different types of substances including
     chemicals, metals, minerals, electricity, food and more. The interest I
     have in choosing two very similiar charts is the ability to compare them
     over time. For a large scale project it would be beneficial to collect
     the same tables of data over a ten or twenty year span in order to
     see how effectively we have been dealing with the emmissions from our
     factories. I believe visualizing this data could display the factory types
     produce the most emmissions which would be useful in finding the
     factories that need the most attention in order to reduce emmissions.
     With a little research on which factories are striving to decrease Emmissions
     the data could also illustrate the effectiveness of the strategies they
     are using. You could even go further and graph the data on
     a picture of the United States using the longitudes and latitudes input
     in order to place the data based on its real life location in order
     to display the emmissions based on the state that factory is in.
     This could give further insight into what areas are taking the making the
     most changes to their emmission sizes and what areas aren't.
